\chapter{Introduction}


\label{chapIntroduction}

The Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) has reported the numerous problems it has detecting faults that arise on its campus and its facilities, whose reparation usually takes excessive time and is poorly organized. A late detection of faults in the facilities delays its reparation, stopping its users to continue using them as normal and complicating the maintenance staff labor. Regarding the wishes of the campus users and realizing the potential maintenance problems it has, the UAM has organized a contest to choose the best project proposal that solves them.

This is where our organization, Triforce, enters the scene: we have analyzed the problem exhaustively and designed a web application, Fault Manager Lite (FML), that meets all the requirements expected, solves the problems and also includes new extra features that makes it even more useful.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this Risk Analysis document is to provide a detailed description of the risks associated with this project, given the current constraints of time and budget. A plan for monitoring, prevention and mitigation of risks is also presented.

The intended audience of this document is the executive team of Triforce, in order to know and evaluate the risks that this project carries.

\section{Structure}

The document is structured as follows. This chapter serves as introduction and description of the document and its contents.

Chapter \ref{chapReferences} contains the references used to define, analyze and estimate the risks of the project.

In chapter \ref{chapDef} we review the project definition and the subsystems it has.

Our planned schedule and cost estimations is presented in chapter \ref{chapPlan}. We also include some important requirements of the project, the ones related to our detected risks.

Finally, chapters \ref{chapRiskAnalysis}, \ref{chapRiskManagement} and \ref{chapRiskMonitoring} includes the analysis (identification and estimation) of the risk in FML project, how we plan to management them and finally the monitoring process we will use to ensure the risk don't materialize.

The appendices contain extra information, such as the Riskology tool output (appendix \ref{chapRiskology}) and the detailed Gantt diagram (appendix \ref{chapGantt}).

\section{Scope}

The final goal of the system we want to develop is integrating in a single application an user-friendly report system of faults on the facilities of the UAM campus with an efficient repair task manager for the maintenance staff of the UAM. Moreover, the application will provide statistics of the reported faults and will count with extra features such as a notification and messaging system which may serve as a communication channel between campus members and campus technicians.

What makes this system unique and useful for the UAM is the union of different features (report system and task management) from other applications, but specially designed taking into account the UAM's maintenance service current needs. More information and exhaustive analysis about other similar applications can be found in Fault Manager Lite SRS \cite{requirements15}.

Other main goal of the application is the equalization of the working way of the different departments of the maintenance service. Nowadays they are self-organized and they lack of much coordination, which leads to a continuous loss of time in the troubleshooting of faults. Therefore, this application aims to substitute the organization methods of the different maintenance departments.

Fault Manager Lite will use the UAM's authentication system in order to access the application; therefore, it will not substitute the current authentication system nor store in its own database any UAM's credentials. However, the application will have its own users database in order to properly manage them inside its limits (i.e. for banning or messaging reasons).

The requirements analysis contained in this document has two fundamental objectives: the first one, to serve as a first version for its review by the client company (in this case, the UAM), who will be able to specify if they want any extra functionality or, on the contrary, they want to quit any of the extracted requirements; the other one, it will be used as a basis for the system size estimation that will let us know the approximate duration, personnel needed and expected costs of the project. Therefore, the requirements are not definitive in any way, and can be extended or modified in the analysis phases that will be performed during the development.

The project plan obtained from the estimations will be the one used if the direction of Triforce approves the estimated costs and duration as long as the client doesn't ask for changes on the requirements that can cause great variations in the estimated effort. On the contrary, a new version of the project plan that considers the new conditions will be needed.

\section{Responsibilities}

For FML project organization purposes, a several charges of responsibility have been designated as seen in Table \ref{tbl_Responsibilities} depending on the performance and abilities shown in previous projects developed in Triforce.

Each one of these persons will be in charge of the management and coordination of its dedicated section, as well as the communication with other sections implied in the project.

\chapter{Risk management}
\label{chapRiskManagement}

The risks related to requirement specifications (\ref{riskReqChange}, \ref{riskAttitude}, \ref{riskFeaturesUnexpected}, \ref{riskExpectations}) can be managed ensuring that the client approves the requirements specified in the Requirements Specification Document. It's also necessary to get continuous feedback from the client to ensure that the system is catered to their needs and that any needed change or fix is detected as early as possible.

About the risks related to novel features (risks \ref{riskLocalization}, \ref{riskAlgorithms}, \ref{riskRealTime}), given the time constraints it doesn't seem feasible to make prototypes and proof-of-concept applications to ensure that the features work. So, the only possible actions are mitigative: the system should be designed to work even if each feature can't be developed in time. For example, alternative input methods for localization should be implemented in order to mitigate risk \ref{riskLocalization}, and basic algorithms should be developed to avoid problems if the risk \ref{riskAlgorithms} materializes.

To manage the risk of errors happening with the UAM's authentication API (risk \ref{riskAuthServer}), the system should be designing with the decoupling of the authentication server in mind. This approach will allow tests that are independent of the authentication server behavior, and will make a system resilient to changes in the authentication server interface.

If the targeted phone operating system changes (risk \ref{riskPhone}), we can count on the fact that breaking changes are highly unlikely to occur. Even in that case, an initial launch of the system that doesn't target the new and breaking version of that operating system can be considered.

To manage the lack of precedences in development (risk \ref{riskPrec}), if too many problems arise, an external expert consultant may be hired to solve them in a small amount of time, in order to avoid time delays and their corresponding costs.
