\chapter{Introduction}


\label{chapIntroduction}

The Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) has reported the numerous problems it has detecting faults that arise on its campus and its facilities, whose reparation usually takes excessive time and is poorly organized. A late detection of faults in the facilities delays its reparation, stopping its users to continue using them as normal and complicating the maintenance staff labor. Regarding the wishes of the campus users and realizing the potential maintenance problems it has, the UAM has organized a contest to choose the best project proposal that solves them.

This is where our organization, Triforce, enters the scene: we have analyzed the problem exhaustively and designed a web application, Fault Manager Lite (FML), that meets all the requirements expected, solves the problems and also includes new extra features that makes it even more useful.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this Risk Analysis document is to provide a detailed description of the risks associated with this project, given the current constraints of time and budget. A plan for monitoring, prevention and mitigation of risks is also presented.

The intended audience of this document is the executive team of Triforce, in order to know and evaluate the risks that this project carries.

\section{Structure}

The document is structured as follows. This chapter serves as introduction and description of the document and its contents.

Chapter \ref{chapReferences} contains the references used to define, analyze and estimate the risks of the project.

In chapter \ref{chapDef} we review the project definition and the subsystems it has.

Our planned schedule and cost estimations is presented in chapter \ref{chapPlan}. We also include some important requirements of the project, the ones related to our detected risks.

Finally, chapters \ref{chapRiskAnalysis}, \ref{chapRiskManagement} and \ref{chapRiskMonitoring} includes the analysis (identification and estimation) of the risk in FML project, how we plan to management them and finally the monitoring process we will use to ensure the risk don't materialize.

The appendices contain extra information, such as the Riskology tool output (appendix \ref{chapRiskology}) and the detailed Gantt diagram (appendix \ref{chapGantt}).

\section{Scope}

The final goal of the system we want to develop is integrating in a single application an user-friendly report system of faults on the facilities of the UAM campus with an efficient repair task manager for the maintenance staff of the UAM. Moreover, the application will provide statistics of the reported faults and will count with extra features such as a notification and messaging system which may serve as a communication channel between campus members and campus technicians.

What makes this system unique and useful for the UAM is the union of different features (report system and task management) from other applications, but specially designed taking into account the UAM's maintenance service current needs. More information and exhaustive analysis about other similar applications can be found in Fault Manager Lite SRS \cite{requirements15}.

Other main goal of the application is the equalization of the working way of the different departments of the maintenance service. Nowadays they are self-organized and they lack of much coordination, which leads to a continuous loss of time in the troubleshooting of faults. Therefore, this application aims to substitute the organization methods of the different maintenance departments.

Fault Manager Lite will use the UAM's authentication system in order to access the application; therefore, it will not substitute the current authentication system nor store in its own database any UAM's credentials. However, the application will have its own users database in order to properly manage them inside its limits (i.e. for banning or messaging reasons).

The requirements analysis contained in this document has two fundamental objectives: the first one, to serve as a first version for its review by the client company (in this case, the UAM), who will be able to specify if they want any extra functionality or, on the contrary, they want to quit any of the extracted requirements; the other one, it will be used as a basis for the system size estimation that will let us know the approximate duration, personnel needed and expected costs of the project. Therefore, the requirements are not definitive in any way, and can be extended or modified in the analysis phases that will be performed during the development.

The project plan obtained from the estimations will be the one used if the direction of Triforce approves the estimated costs and duration as long as the client doesn't ask for changes on the requirements that can cause great variations in the estimated effort. On the contrary, a new version of the project plan that considers the new conditions will be needed.

\section{Responsibilities}

For FML project organization purposes, a several charges of responsibility have been designated as seen in Table \ref{tbl_Responsibilities} depending on the performance and abilities shown in previous projects developed in Triforce.

Each one of these persons will be in charge of the management and coordination of its dedicated section, as well as the communication with other sections implied in the project.

\chapter{Conclusions}

This Risk Management and Planning document covers all the analysis (identification, estimation, assessment), management (mitigation and prevention plans) and monitoring (control and tracking plans) of risks detected in the Fault Manager Lite software project, that is going developed by the Triforce company as a request from the Autonomous University of Madrid.

The risk analysis has been performed answering the Taxonomy-based Questionnaire contained in the Taxonomy-based Risk Identification document. Then, each risk has been given a priority attending to their estimated probability of ocurrence and impact on the project.

For the most demanding risks (those with higher priorities), we have designed some mitigation and prevention plans to either prevent their appearance or their consequences they would have in our project time schedule or activities planning.

Finally, we have recommended the establishment of specific control and tracking plans for those urgent risks.

The purpose of this document is to be used as a reference guide when dealing with the risks of the FML software system. In case this document is properly followed during the whole development process, it will:

\begin{itemize}
\item Increase the likelihood of achieving the goals of the FML project.
\item Minimize the losses for the company.
\item Encourage an active project management.
\item Identify and deal with the project's risks.
\item Increase the product and the process quality.
\end{itemize}

However, this document will only be applicable to the project risks if it has been periodically updated regarding its development. Some of the risks can only trigger in a specific moment of the project (discrete risks), while others demand more attention, as they can happen at any moment (continuous risks). The contingency and mitigation plans will not be effective enough if they haven't been applied on time or adapted to the current status of the project. Therefore, it is highly recommended the scheduling of revisions of this document in order to discard risks that have been avoided and can't happen, update the still applicable risks taking into account the current status and characteristics of the project development and add new risks that have unexpectedly appeared or had not been detected in previous revisions.

This way, we would maintain the Risk Management and Planning document up-to-date with respect to its corresponding project. This parallel evolution of the project development and its risks document will allow us to apply efficient mitigation measures if needed.

In case of failure of this project, we recommend the scheduling of an audit so that we would know the exact causes that lead the project to fail. This causes should be taken into account in the Risk Management documents of future projects developed by the Triforce company, to increase their probabilities of success.

We've used the Riskology tool \cite{riskology} to evaluate the risks of the project and the expected delays. We've used the probabilities from section \ref{secRiskEstimation} and adjusted the impact to the paradigm of this tool (e.g., our ``very high'' impact is not actually a 80\% delay). Table \ref{tblRiskologyImpact} reflects the used impacts, measured either in relative or absolute (months) delays from the estimated durations. All risks are binary, and the risk corresponding to delays (\rref{riskDelays}) is set as a fatal risk.

According to Riskology, the project will be canceled with a 30 \% probability.
