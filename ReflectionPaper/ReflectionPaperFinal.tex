\section{Content and procedure}
\subsection{Practical assignment procedure}
We did the three practical assignments of SEPRO corresponding to the technical report, the project plan and the risk analysis.

The most time of the work have been done at home, out of the class, mainly in the first and second assignment. As the third one was shorter and we had more time in class we didn't have to work too much out of the class.

\subsection{Strengths of the practical assignment procedure}

We have been using LaTeX to generate the PDF derivable and we have used git to control versions of the documents and to allow parallel work and simultaneous modifications.

To communicate ourselves we used Telegram. It allowed us to be in constant communication (because of the mobile app) and it also allow us very efficient communication when we were working in a computer (because of the web app).

\subsection{Possible improvements of the practical assignment procedure}



\section{Comments on the evolution and progression of the practical assignments}
It has been nice to do the documentation of a project almost since the beginning. First analyzing, then planning and of course, estimating the risks. We appreciate that the last assignment is easier and shorter because we have other works to deliver at the end of the course. 

\section{Problems identified during the term (practical assignments)}
We had problems sometimes when we thought we could spend the time in the laboratory to work in some practical or optional assignment but when we got class we had some theory to see. 

We would have liked to know in advance the planning of the course, in terms of theory hours and working hours.

\section{Learning / knowledge acquired during the term (practical assignments)}

We have improved our formal written English and we have learned to use some tools (such us COCOMO or Riskology). We are not so sure that we are going to use those tools and methodologies in the future because of the incompleteness of some aspects.

\section{Reflection on and analysis of the work completed during the term}
As we mentioned before, we are not very sure that we are going to use the tools and acknowledgments learned during this term because we had some problems to know things for sure so we had to invent too much to consider useful enough this tools. 

On the other hand, we know in real projects may be useful when you dedicate your whole journey to the same project and you are going to spend the next \emph{x} time of your work, so you better estimate that \emph{x} good enough. 

\section{Justification of the major and hardest portfolio contents}
We haven't used (at least conscientiously) the portfolio technique.

\section{Skills developed as a result of the work performed throughout the term}


\section{Importance and applicability of portfolio production for your future profession}
We haven't used (at least conscientiously) the portfolio technique.

\section{Observations}
We think it would be much more interesting and quite more didactic if all this analysis and planning would be used. We think if after the analysis we would have coded the project, we could have learned if that estimation was good. Spanish wisdom says ``De los errores se aprende'', that means ``from errors we learn''. If we just make a planning that we are not going to follow, we can't make any mistake and we miss all that learning we can get from the mistakes we can make.
