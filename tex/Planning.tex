Figure \ref{figGanttSimple} shows a simplified view of the Gantt diagram that represents the schedule of the project. A detailed version of this diagram is included in appendix \ref{chapGantt}.

\subsection{Increment planning}

We have decided to break down the development in 3 increments, each one dedicated to various subsystems. The details of the function points assigned to each increment and the corresponding effort is detailed in table \ref{tblIncrementsSubsystems}. Table \ref{tblSubsystemsAssignedIncrement} reflects the increment in which each subsystem will be completed and the corresponding percentage of each increment's effort dedicated to it.

This is the old detailed estimation of effort in terms of function points.

\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\input{tex/OldIncrementOutline.tex}
\caption{Detail of the old increments and corresponding effort.}
\label{tblIncrementsSubsystems}
\end{table}


As the time we had has been limited (10\% less than our initial estimation), we had to remove some system's functionalities. As a result of that process, we have obtained this new detailed estimation of effort in terms of function points.

\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\input{tex/NewIncrementOutline.tex}
\caption{Detail of the new increments and corresponding effort.}
\label{tblIncrementsSubsystems}
\end{table}

As we can see in the efforts of each subsystems, they have changed. We have 10\% function points less, so we will finish 10\% earlier. The removed functionalities belonged to the messaging module and to the statistics module, the ones we thought that there were more dispensable. 

In table \ref{tblSubsystemsAssignedIncrement} one can see the effort for each subsystem, and one can corroborate that the affected ones are messaging and statistics.

\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\input{tex/SubsystemAndIncrement.tex}
\caption{Assigned increment and effort for each subsystem.}
\label{tblSubsystemsAssignedIncrement}
\end{table}

Now we include the effort for each phase of each increment in the table \ref{tblIncrementPhases} with its corresponding new effort.
